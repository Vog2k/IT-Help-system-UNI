Refective writting

Classes / OOP
Learning about classes was the hardest part for me, when using the self method this made me feel so lost and confused for hours until i finaly realised what the actual classes does

While studying OOP i had come to realise what purpose classes had and how much this can clean's up your code.
I originally had used up multiple lines just copying and pasting my code to use for other things so using classes
and OOP made my code so much cleaner.


User stories

When a user requests a password change, I have designed my password system to recognise this request and to write over
the current password using """"file = open(username + ".txt", "w"""" This will asign the newly created password to that
current users name . This will then send the user to the login stage once the have  signed in with the new password they
can opt for another ticket or decline and carry on with other options

When a user request an ID number there has been a system set up in place, I have used Nidhi's code and from what i have
leaned, Once the user enters the characters 'id' The code will run to produce the id under the binary and hexadecimal
but also using the first characters of the users name. Once this has been completed the ticket will be created and
closed then allowing the user to create another ticket or continue back to the menu
